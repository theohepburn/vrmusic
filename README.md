# vr music

Following methods from google creative labs https://github.com/googlecreativelab/inside-music. vr music allows the users to experience songs in a new way. The aim was to, create an experience for the user to delve deeper into a song and discover the different musical parts that connect to make a song.

I have hosted the audio files needed for this project to work in google drive. This is as a precaution because when I tried to upload these files directly to github the file was too large to be hosted on github. 

The link is below

Once downloaded these audio files will need to put in the stems folder.
