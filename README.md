# Overview 

vrmusic is an musical experiment that was adapted using the files from Inside Music. Using the link below, you can navigate to their original experiment.

Song Exploder Presents: Inside Music is a [WebVR Experiment](https://webvrexperiments.com) that lets you step inside a song, giving you a closer look at how music is made.

Using their existing code and adapting it I aimed to give the listener a new experience to listen to a song. Following their instructions I included my own audio files. The song that I decided to explore was Bruno Mars '24K Magic'. 

# Evaluation

I started by following the instructions outlined in the WebVR Experiment. However, as I was not familiar with running commands through the terminal, I began facing problems. The led to me booking multiple tutorials in order to correct these problems. After numerous attempts I was successful in installing the required dependencies needed in order for the project to work. 

Then came the process of editing the code and adapting it to fit my project.

In order to make the code my own, I made a few changes to enhance it. These included:

Creating a new splash screen to replace the splash screen that was already included inside the folder that was downloaded from Song Exploder.

However, unfortunately When I tried to run the code, I ran into problems. Going through the error logs, I was able to identify what the problem was and rectified it. The problem was that I was trying to run the http server code inside the wrong folder. I re directed the code to the correct folder and ran the code again which was successful.
